#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is an approach where engineers write specific codes or instructions based on one or more programming languages. This results in the development of important products like games and websites. Software engineering is important because it helps solve real-world problems that face our society.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The first evolution milestone period was in the 1940s when software engineering was still pioneering. Engineers at the time utilized manual coding directly on the hardware, which was time-consuming as they provided machines with machine-level instructions by hand.
The second evolution milestone was in the 1950s when high-level programming languages emerged. An example was the inception of languages like COBOL and Fortran, and also the emergence of compliers which helped improve code writing.
Another milestone was the rise of the Internet Age, which saw the emergence of client-server architecture, where clients could interact with products like websites on the Internet, which prompted the emergence of programming languages that would support such architectures.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
There are typically six stages in the cycle. 
The first phase is the planning and requirements phase, where the developer or the team addresses key questions like planning, the scope of the project, the objectives, and the resources that will be needed.
The second phase is the defining requirements section, where the team delves deeper into all the requirements, which will include technical, financial, and functional requirements that will ensure the project succeeds.
The third phase is the design process, where the developer or assigned team begins coming up with the designs, such as the high-level design of a website to understand how it will look.
The fourth phase entails the development process, which involves writing actual code, testing it, reviewing, and collaborating to ensure that client and server-side architecture interact seamlessly.
The fifth phase is testing to ensure that the developed program can now run smoothly in the local development environment and accomplishes its intended roles.
The final phase is deployment to enable clients to have access to the newly built product and provide feedback.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The waterfall approach is a way or an approach in software development that focuses on the linear and sequential development of a product. The key tenet of the approach is that the developers or teams cannot move to the second phase if the first phase has not been approved. Therefore, coming up with a new product will take time as each phase must be scrutinized. An example would be the case of a banking system, which requires a lot of strict regulations to be followed and also a lot of sensitive information on the line. Fast releases of such products could threaten the integrity of the company.
The agile approach focuses on incremental and fast development, where the developers build smaller sections of a product and release it to the consumers to test review, and provide feedback. Instead of delivering the complete product, they focus on releasing a minimally viable product that works and then building upon it as time goes. An example is a new music application on the phone. The developers will release the basic features first and then work on adding to them based on the feedback they receive.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

As the name suggests, the software developer is responsible for the development part, where they write efficient codes, test the functionality of the code, and make use of tools like APIs to help ensure that the product is running.
The quality assurance engineer is responsible for ensuring the released products meet the needed quality standards, which entails creating unit tests and also test cases that ensure that the product functions across different scenarios subjected to it.
The project manager has the role of coming up with a plan and a timeline for the whole project, as well as assigning different people or teams their roles. They are responsible or ensuring that projects are delivered within stipulated time.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs are crucial because they provide developers with the workspace that they need to write code. These IDEs make it possible for them to edit code, use debugging tools, and produce products that meet the required needs. An example is a popular tool called Visual Studio Code.
Version controls are critical because they are used to support code changes, management, and collaboration. These controls allow developers to save their code away from their local machines, and also support collaboration between teams. They also help in tracking changes made to different parts of the code. An example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
The first challenge is bugs. It is one of the challenges that every developer must deal with as they develop products. One solution is to use debugging tools like printing out different responses to see if errors pop up and incremental code writing, where the developer tests each small section before proceeding to help easily identify where the error is occurring.
The second challenge is time management. Developers can sometimes face issues of time constraints, which may come because of changing deadlines or increasing workloads. One clear solution is to establish a clear communication line, which ensures that all parties are aware of what should be delivered and understand that additional requirements will prolong the completion date.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is the process of testing components that are used or developed in a product. For example, in the case of a website, a unit test can be created to test whether login and signup are working efficiently.
Integration testing is broader as it focuses on more modules or components to see how they work together. An example is when a developer uses Postman to test an endpoint, which means that they will need to see if different sections of the code are working to produce the desired result.
System testing is testing the whole software system to see whether it is accomplishing its intended roles, such as seeing whether a new app released is compatible with different mobile phone systems.
Acceptance testing is when users are given the power to now provide feedback on whether the released products meets their intended needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is about giving instructions that are clear, concise, and specific, which leads the AI to give optimal results. Prompt engineering is important because vague instructions lead to vague results that are not suitable.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: Tell me about Donald J Trump's election victory

Clear Prompt: What are four factors that helped Donald J Trump win the 2024 election
